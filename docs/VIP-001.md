## 1. Summary

This VIP defines the foundational data structures for Valorium X, establishing the core elements necessary for transaction processing and block formation within the protocol.

## 2. Motivation

A standardized foundation ensures interoperability, traceability, and modularity across the Valorium X network and future protocol upgrades.

## 3. Specification

### 3.1 Transaction

- **Definition**: Represents a transfer of value between accounts or addresses within the network.
- **Example (generic structure)**:
    ```json
    {
      "sender": "VX1abc...xyz",
      "recipient": "VX1def...uvw",
      "amount": 1000,
      "timestamp": 1721428800,
      "hash": "QDRT1234abcd...",
      "metadata": {}
    }
    ```
- **Note**: The `hash` field is a Quadrit hash, ensuring unique identification and integrity. Metadata is optional and may include tags or references for application-specific purposes.

### 3.2 RnaTemplate

- **Definition**: Lightweight template referencing a list of transaction hashes. Used for batch validation and modular processing.
- **Example**:
    ```json
    {
      "template_id": "RT-001",
      "transactions": [
        "QDRT1234abcd...",
        "QDRT5678efgh...",
        "QDRT9012ijkl..."
      ],
      "metadata": {}
    }
    ```
- **Note**: Enables efficient grouping and referencing of multiple transactions.

### 3.3 CIP (Consensus Integrity Proof)

- **Definition**: Simulates proof-of-consensus for the block or transaction set. Concrete mechanisms are to be specified in future VIPs.
- **Example**:
    ```json
    {
      "proof_type": "simulated",
      "participants": ["NODE1", "NODE2", "NODE3"],
      "signature": "SIGabcd1234...",
      "proof_data": {}
    }
    ```
- **Note**: The fields here are placeholders and subject to expansion as the consensus mechanism evolves.

### 3.4 Block

- **Definition**: Primary unit of the ledger, containing all essential data for state progression.
- **Example**:
    ```json
    {
      "block_id": "B-000001",
      "timestamp": 1721428800,
      "transactions": [ ... ],
      "rna_template": { ... },
      "cip": { ... },
      "previous_block_hash": "QDRTprevblock...",
      "block_hash": "QDRTnewblock..."
    }
    ```
- **Note**: Each block links to the previous one via `previous_block_hash`, ensuring chain integrity.

## 5. Status

**Adopted**  
This specification serves as the reference point for all future extensions and improvements to the Valorium X protocol. Updates must be proposed through new VIPs referencing this document.
