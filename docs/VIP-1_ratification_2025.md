## 1. Abstract

This VIP proposes the official ratification of the “Grand Œuvre 2025.1” (whitepaper.md) as the foundational document for the Valorium X protocol, including all architectural, philosophical, and governance principles described therein.

---

## 2. Rationale & Motivation

The Grand Œuvre is the living constitution and technical charter of Valorium X. Its ratification is required before any further protocol improvement or DAO activity can be considered legitimate under the Immutable Laws.

---

## 3. Specification & Scope

- The whitepaper.md (2025.1) is adopted as the highest source of protocol truth.
- All subsequent proposals (VIP) must reference and respect this document.
- The current document hash is:

## 4. Compatibility & Backward Impact

No breaking changes. This VIP sets the baseline for all future protocol evolution.

## 5. Security & Constitution Alignment

This is a constitutional proposal. It is by definition aligned with all Immutable Laws.

---

## 6. Implementation Plan

- Community review and discussion (Discord, GitHub, DAO portal)
- On-chain or off-chain voting
- Upon acceptance, the hash is registered and all future VIPs must reference it
