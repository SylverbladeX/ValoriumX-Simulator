# ValoriumX-Simulator

> 🚀 **Current Status:**  
> _The Visionary MVP Valorium X is currently in Phase 1 of its roadmap. Our primary objective is the mathematical validation and intensive simulation of our core innovation: the Cryptographic Interlocking Proof (CIP) coupled with the Quadrit data system. The goal of this phase is to produce a technical paper and an open-source simulator that prove the robustness of our consensus mechanism._

Valorium X is a bio-inspired blockchain simulator (“First Helix”) designed to explore innovative consensus models and cryptographic systems.

## 🚀 Vision

- **Biomimetics**: RNA/CIP/Block workflow inspired by natural processes
- **Quadrit Hashing**: Security, uniqueness, and innovative cryptography
- **Modularity**: Hybrid architecture (bio-inspired and/or simple modes)
- **Transparency & Community Governance**: Valorium Improvement Proposals (VIPs)

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SylverbladeX/ValoriumX-Simulator.git
cd ValoriumX-Simulator
python main.py
```

## 🛠️ Usage Modes

- **Bio-inspired mode** (RNA/CIP workflow)
- **Simple mode** (classic Quadrit mining)

> Set the mode in `main.py`:  
> `MODE = "bio"` or `"simple"`
